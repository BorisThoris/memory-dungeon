## Problem
**Steam** **demo** **full** product **packaging** checklist (build IDs, depots, copy) — **client**-side readiness aligned with `REG-060` and `REG-040` / `REG-030` feature flags.

## Target Experience
Relevant UI and data paths meet the **Choose Path or better** bar on phone and desktop, with trustable local saves. Competitive **online** leaderboards and mandatory **online** services remain **out of scope** for v1 per `REG-052` and the README refinement bar — local/offline first.

## Suggested Implementation
- Cross-link `REG-061`, `REG-040` / `REG-030` `REG-115`, and `REG-040` / `REG-030` demo column in matrices; not **online** services.

## Acceptance Criteria
- This document’s scope is resolvable as one or more implementation PRs with clear verification, without requiring final licensed assets in this pass.
- Links to related REG tasks are present and the overlap with `REG-015`–`REG-021`, `REG-040`–`REG-043`, and `REG-052` is acknowledged where relevant.
- The **Placeholder and asset contract (placeholderNeeded)** section states either **Not applicable** or required slots and fallbacks.

## Verification
- File includes: Status, Priority, Area, Evidence, Problem, Target Experience, Suggested Implementation, Acceptance Criteria, Verification, **Placeholder and asset contract (placeholderNeeded)**, and **Cross-links**.
- `git status --short` for implementation work is scoped and reviewable.
- No schema change is *required* by this markdown-only definition; implementation work follows separately.

## Placeholder and asset contract (placeholderNeeded)
- **Slots (planning):** list icon sizes, key art, audio stingers, and store media required for ship quality.
- **Fallbacks (allowed):** reuse existing in-game frames, `silence` / procedural SFX, solid panels, and placeholder copy.
- **Bot constraint:** the implementation agent must not generate or license final shippable art, audio, or legal text; it wires placeholders and documents acceptance slots only.

## Implementation

`scripts/write-steam-appid.mjs` writes `steam_appid.txt` from `STEAM_APP_ID` before every package script and refuses the Spacewar id 480. `yarn package:win:demo` packages the demo flavour. No shared cloud app id is configured (Valve: shared cloud does not sync against an unreleased base app).
