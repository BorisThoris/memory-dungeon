# Gameplay platform migration

## Architectural decision

Memory Dungeon keeps strict TypeScript, Electron, React, PixiJS, Zustand, and the existing deterministic rule suite. The migration changes ownership rather than replacing the product stack:

- serializable commands enter the shared gameplay core;
- pure reducers emit domain events and the next run state;
- typed effect definitions express triggers, conditions, state changes, and feedback requests;
- renderer and audio adapters consume state and feedback events but do not define gameplay truth;
- existing rule functions remain compatibility adapters until parity tests prove that a slice can replace them;
- `.ai/repo-model.json` measures code, test, state, feedback, and content coverage throughout the migration.

Legacy paths are removed only after deterministic replay, focused parity tests, and seeded simulation cover their behavior.

## First vertical slice: Conduit Cartographer

The first slice follows an existing player build rather than adding a disconnected feature:

1. A player chooses the `echo_conduit_lens` bonus reward or `peek_charge_plus_one` relic.
2. Echo and Conduit trait matches trigger their typed effects.
3. Effects grant and consume the `peek_charge` inventory item through shared commands.
4. The Peek board power resolves through the deterministic core.
5. Mystery-route and hidden-hazard information creates a downstream routing decision.
6. HUD, board, audio, and accessibility feedback describe the cause, resource change, and available consequence.

The slice is complete only when:

- command and event payloads are serializable and schema-validated;
- seeded replay produces the same state and event sequence;
- existing Echo, Conduit, reward, relic, inventory, Peek, route, save, and feedback behavior has parity coverage;
- headless simulation can exercise the build without renderer state;
- its content nodes connect to source, state, feedback, consequence, persistence, and tests in the semantic model;
- no source of truth is duplicated between the shared core and Zustand/React.

After this proof slice, migrate the other source-derived content families build by build, prioritizing connections that reduce the `unmodeled_content_family` diagnostics rather than maximizing raw mechanic count.

## Current slice status

Implemented in the first command-core increment:

- strict, versioned schemas for sources, facts, conditions, effects, commands, content definitions, and domain events;
- pure command reduction over existing reward, relic, inventory, trait, and Peek primitives;
- atomic condition rejection with explainable events;
- deterministic event IDs/order and JSON-round-trippable command replay;
- parity tests for Echo Conduit Lens, Peek Charge relic, Echo/Conduit perk bonus, and Peek board legality;
- live renderer Peek actions routed through the command core, with audio driven by the typed feedback event instead of a parallel hardcoded cause;
- semantic graph coverage from content choice through state, feedback, route consequence, persistence boundary, and replay gate.

Still required before the vertical slice is complete:

- route live bonus-reward, relic-pick, and trait-match actions through the command core adapters;
- persist the command/event journal with save-version migration and bounded retention;
- consume typed feedback events in renderer/audio/accessibility adapters;
- execute Conduit Cartographer through the headless balance simulator and add seeded fairness assertions.
