# Gameplay platform migration

## Architectural decision

Memory Dungeon keeps strict TypeScript, Electron, React, PixiJS, Zustand, and the existing deterministic rule suite. The migration changes ownership rather than replacing the product stack:

- serializable commands enter the shared gameplay core;
- pure reducers emit domain events and the next run state;
- typed effect definitions express triggers, conditions, state changes, and feedback requests;
- renderer and audio adapters consume state and feedback events but do not define gameplay truth;
- existing rule functions remain compatibility adapters until parity tests prove that a slice can replace them;
- `.ai/repo-model.json` measures code, test, state, feedback, and content coverage throughout the migration.

Legacy paths are removed only after deterministic replay, focused parity tests, and seeded simulation cover their behavior.

## First vertical slice: Conduit Cartographer

The first slice follows an existing player build rather than adding a disconnected feature:

1. A player chooses the `echo_conduit_lens` bonus reward or `peek_charge_plus_one` relic.
2. Echo and Conduit trait matches trigger their typed effects.
3. Effects grant and consume the `peek_charge` inventory item through shared commands.
4. The Peek board power resolves through the deterministic core.
5. Mystery-route and hidden-hazard information creates a downstream routing decision.
6. HUD, board, audio, and accessibility feedback describe the cause, resource change, and available consequence.

The slice is complete only when:

- command and event payloads are serializable and schema-validated;
- seeded replay produces the same state and event sequence;
- existing Echo, Conduit, reward, relic, inventory, Peek, route, save, and feedback behavior has parity coverage;
- headless simulation can exercise the build without renderer state;
- its content nodes connect to source, state, feedback, consequence, persistence, and tests in the semantic model;
- no source of truth is duplicated between the shared core and Zustand/React.

After this proof slice, migrate the other source-derived content families build by build, prioritizing connections that reduce the `unmodeled_content_family` diagnostics rather than maximizing raw mechanic count.
